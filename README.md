Snake cube puzzle consists of 27 unit cubes that are held sequentially together by a shock-cord. Each cube can be rotated around the cord. The cube is either ”straight-through”, S (the cord passed through one face of the cube and exits throught the opposite face), or is an ”elbow”, E (the cord passed through one face and exists through another perpendicular face). 

Problem: shape the snake into a 3x3x3 cube.
